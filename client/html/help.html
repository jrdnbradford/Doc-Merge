        <h1>Sheet &amp; Template Doc Setup</h1>
        <h2>Sheet</h2>
        <p>Copy the Google Sheet and add in your data. Ensure that the header
        is set in the first row.</p>

        <h2>Template Doc</h2>
        <p>Your template Doc should have fields corresponding to your Google
        Sheet's headers, surrounded by double less-than and greater-than signs
        (for example, &lt;&lt;First Name&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;Zip Code&gt;&gt;).
        These parts of your Doc will be replaced with the corresponding data
        in the sheet. The data in the header and rows of your Google Sheet
        should <em>not</em> have less-than and greater-than signs.</p>

        <h1>Configuration Fields</h1>
        <h2>Google Doc Template URL</h2>
        <p>The URL to the Google Doc Template. You must have <em>at least</em>
        view access to the Doc.</p>

        <h2>Merge Folder Name</h2>
        <p>The name of the folder that will be created in the root of your Google
        Drive to hold your merged Docs. By default it will be set as the name of
        the template's title plus "Merge".</p>

        <h2>Merge Type</h2>
        <p>The format of the files to be merged. By default it is set to merge
        as PDFs.</p>

        <h2>File Name</h2>
        <p>The sheet column by which to name the merged files. The available
        options are the names of the columns in the sheet. If the sheet has a
        Last Name column, this will be set as the default. If you keep this default
        setting, each merged file will be named after the data in the Last Name
        column.</p>

        <h2>Share Via Drive</h2>
        <p>This option is only available if your Google Sheet has an email
        column that can be used to grant view access to the resulting documents.
        If you choose to merge as PDFs, an email notification is sent notifying
        the recipient that access has been granted to the PDF. If you choose to
        merge as Docs, no email notification is sent (due to a limitation with
        Google's API), but view access is still given to the account.</p>

        <h1>Quotas &amp; Limitations</h1>
        <p>Google has <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas"
        target="_blank">quotas and limitations</a> regarding how many documents you can create
        daily and how long scripts (like the one in this Google Sheet) can run.</p>
